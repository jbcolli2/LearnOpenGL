# LearnOpenGL

I am working through the tutorial on [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/).  I'm trying to learn basic graphics programming, and also polish my C++ programming skills.  As I implement the various aspects of the tutorial, I also organize the code using basic design patterns to allow the code to be sustainable and modifiable.
